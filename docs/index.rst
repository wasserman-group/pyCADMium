Welcome to pyCADMium!
=====================

Python module that uses a prolate spheroidal (PS) coordinate grid to accurately perform computational chemistry calculations on atoms and diatomic molecules. The name is an acronym for "Chemical Atoms in Molecules" that references the idea of chemically significant fragments within a molecule.  
*pyCADMium* originated in a proprietary programming language but has been rewritten from the ground up as an open-source alternative.
